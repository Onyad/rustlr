to allow productions E --> (E ;)* E

need to: distinguish ; from other symbols (operators?) that carry semantic meaning,
unless -, + : these are non-terminals with rusttype () and precedence 0.

This is not the same as identifying rusttype ().



 -- but in some grammars [] have non-zero precedence

 -- can also just assign precedence 1 to a symbol to give it meaning.

-- Then need to pre-process strtoks (...)* by intro another symbol, prior to
processing of *.
