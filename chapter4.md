## Chapter 4: Automatically Generating the AST and Using Regex in Grammars

One of the advantages of writing ambiguous grammars, e.g., `E-->E+E` instead of `E-->E+T`, is that it becomes easier to generate reasonable abstract syntax representations automatically.  Extra symbols such as `T` that are required for unambiguous grammars generally have no meaning at the abstract syntax level and will only lead to convoluted ASTs.  Rustlr is capable of automatically generating the data structures (enums and structs) for the abstract syntax of a language as well as the semantic actions required to create instances of those structures.  For beginners new to writing grammars and parsers, we **do not** recommend starting with an automatically generated AST.  The user must understand clearly the relationship between concrete and abstract syntax and the best way to learn this relationship is by writing ASTs by hand, as demonstrated in the previous chapters.  Even with Rustlr capable of generating nearly everything one might need from a parser, it is still likely that careful fine tuning will be required.

We redo the enhanced calculator example from [Chapter 2][chap2].  The following grammar is found [here](https://cs.hofstra.edu/~cscccl/rustlr_project/autocalc/calcauto.grammar).

```rust
lifetime 'lt
nonterminals Expr ExprList
terminals + - * / ( ) =
terminals let in
lexterminal SEMICOLON ;
valueterminal int i64 Num(n) n
valueterminal var~ &'lt str~ Alphanum(n)~ n
lexattribute set_line_comment("#")
topsym ExprList
resync SEMICOLON

left * 500
left / 500
left + 400
left - 400
left = 300

Expr:Val --> int
Expr:Var --> var
Expr:Letexp --> let var = Expr in Expr
Expr:Plus --> Expr + Expr
Expr:Minus --> Expr - Expr
Expr:Div --> Expr / Expr
Expr:Times --> Expr * Expr
Expr(600):Neg --> - Expr
Expr --> ( Expr )
ExprList:nil -->
ExprList:cons --> Expr SEMICOLON ExprList
EOF
```

Note the following differences between this grammar and the one presented in [Chapter 2][chap2]:

1. There are no semantic actions
2. There is no "absyntype" or "valuetype" declaration; any such declaration would be ignored when used with the -auto (or -genabsyn) option.
3. Only the types of values carried by certain terminal symbols must be declared (with `typedterminal` or `valueterminal`).  A `valueterminal` declaration is
just a combination of a `typedterminal` and a `lexvalue` declaration, while
a `lexterminal` line combines a `terminal` and a `lexname` declaration.
4. The non-terminal symbol on the left-hand side of a production rule may carry a label.  These labels will become the names of enum variants to be created.

Process the grammar with **`rustlr calcauto.grammar -auto`** (or **`-genabsyn`**).   Two files are created.  Besides **[calcautoparser.rs](https://cs.hofstra.edu/~cscccl/rustlr_project/autocalc/src/calcautoparser.rs)** there will be, in the
same folder as the parser, a **[calcauto_ast.rs](https://cs.hofstra.edu/~cscccl/rustlr_project/autocalc/src/calcauto_ast.rs)** with the following (principal) contents:

```
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum ExprList<'lt> {
  nil,
  cons(Expr<'lt>,LBox<ExprList<'lt>>),
  ExprList_Nothing,
}
impl<'lt> Default for ExprList<'lt> { fn default()->Self { ExprList::ExprList_No
thing } }

#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum Expr<'lt> {
  Times(LBox<Expr<'lt>>,LBox<Expr<'lt>>),
  Div(LBox<Expr<'lt>>,LBox<Expr<'lt>>),
  Neg(LBox<Expr<'lt>>),
  Var(&'lt str),
  Minus(LBox<Expr<'lt>>,LBox<Expr<'lt>>),
  Plus(LBox<Expr<'lt>>,LBox<Expr<'lt>>),
  Letexp(&'lt str,LBox<Expr<'lt>>,LBox<Expr<'lt>>),
  Val(i64),
  Expr_Nothing,
}
impl<'lt> Default for Expr<'lt> { fn default()->Self { Expr::Expr_Nothing } }
```

An enum is created for each non-terminal symbol of the grammar that appears on the left-hand side of multiple production rules. The name of the enum is the
same as the name of the non-terminal.
The names of the variants are derived from the labels given to the left-hand side nonterminal, or are automatically generated from the nonterminal name and the rule number (e.g. `Expr_8`).  A special `Nothing` variant is also created to represent a default.
There is essentially an enum variant for each production rule of this non-terminal.  Each variant is composed of the right-hand side
symbols of the rule that are associated with non-unit types.  Unit typed values
can also become part of the enum if the symbol is given a label.  For example:
  **` E:acase -->  a E `**  where terminal symbol `a` is of unit type, will result in a enum variant
`acase(LBox<E>)`. whereas
  **` E:acase -->  a:m E `**
will result in a variant `acase((),LBox<E>)`

A struct is created for any non-terminal symbol that appears on the
left-hand side of exactly one production rule. The name of the struct
is the same as the non-terminal.  If any of the grammar symbols
on the right-hand side of the rule is given a label, it would create a struct
with the fields of each struct named by these labels, or
with `_item{i}_` if
no labels are given.  For example, a nonterminal `Ifelse` with a singleton rule
  ```
  Ifelse --> if Expr:condition Expr else Expr
  ```
will result in the generation of:
  ```
  #[derive(Default,Debug)]
  pub struct Ifelse {
    pub condition: LBox<Expr>,
    pub _item2_: LBox<Expr>,
    pub _item4_: LBox<Expr>,
  }
  ```
The `_item{i}_` labels are generated from the positions of the corresponding
symbols on the right-hand side of the production rule.
If none of the symbols on the right have labels, rustlr creates a tuple
struct.  For Example a singleton rule such as **`whileloop --> while ( expr ) expr`**
will produce an a `struct whileloop(expr,expr);`  Be careful to avoid
using Rust keywords as the names of non-terminals.

The struct may be empty if all right-hand-side symbols of the single production
rule are associated with the unit type and do not have labels.

Rustlr also calculates a reachability closure so it is aware of which
non-terminals are mutually recursive.  It uses this information to
determine where a smart pointer is needed when defining these
recursive types.  Rustlr always uses its [LBox][2] custom smartpointer
to also include line/column information.  Notice that the variant
`enum::cons` has only the second component in an LBox.  One can, for
the sake of recording position information, always create an LBox
regardless of reachability by giving the component a "boxed label".
That is, `ExprList:cons --> Expr:[car] SEMICOLON ExprList` will
generate a variant that also has its first component in an LBox.  The
reachability relation also determines if a type requires a lifetime
parameter.

Although the generated parser may not be very readable, rustlr also generated semantic actions that create instances of these AST types.  For example, the rule `Expr:Plus --> Expr + Expr` will have semantic action equivalent to one created from:

```
Expr --> Expr:[a] + Expr:[b] {Plus(a,b)}
```

Recall from [Chapter 2][chap2] that a label of the form `[a]` means that the semantic value associated with the symbol is enclosed in an [LBox][2].

The production rule `Expr --> ( Expr )` is also treated in a special way:
note that there is no variant that correspond to this rule in the generated enum.  Rustlr infers from the fact that
  1. there is no left-hand side label to the nonterminal.
  2. `Expr` is the only grammar symbol on the right-hand side that has a non-unit
     type, and that type is the same as the type of the left-hand side symbol.
  3. There are no labels nor operator precedence/associativity declarations for the other symbols.
     
In other words, it infers that the parentheses on the right hand side carry
no meaning at the AST level, and thus generates a semantic action for this rule
that would be equivalent to:
```
  Expr --> ( Expr:e ) { e }
```
We refer to such cases as "pass-thru" cases.  If the automatically
inferred "meaning" of this rule is not what's desired, it can be
altered by using an explicit left-side label: this will generate a
separate enum variant (at the cost of an extra LBox) that
distinguishes the presence of the parentheses.  The rule
`Expr(600):Neg --> - Expr` was not recognized as a pass-thru case for
two reasons: it has a left-side label (`Neg`), and the minus sign was
assigned a precedence and associativity.
We can also force the minus sign to be
included in the AST by giving it an explicit lable such as `-:minus Expr`.


In general, the usage of labels greatly affect how the AST datatype is
generated.  Labels on the left-hand side of a production rule give
names to enum variants.  Their presence also cancel "pass-thru"
recognition by always generating a type or enum variant for the rule.
Labels on the right-hand side give names to struct components.  Their
presence on unit-typed grammar symbols means that symbol won't be
ignored and will be included in the the type.  If a non-terminal has a
single production rule, the lack of labels on the right-hand side leads
to the creation of a simpler tuple struct.  Finally, the use of box
labels such as [e] forces the semantic value to be wrapped inside an LBox
whether or not it is required to define recursive types.

#### Overriding Types and Actions

It is always possible to override the automatically generated type and action.
In case of ExprList, the labels 'nil' and 'cons' are sufficient for rustlr to create a linked-list data structure.  However, the right-recursive grammar rule is slightly non-optimal for LR parsing (the parse stack grows until the last element of the list before ExprList-reductions take place).  One might wish to use a left-recursive rule and a Rust vector to represent a sequence of expressions.  This can be done by making the following changes to the grammar.  First, change the declaration of the non-terminal symbol `ExprList`Â as follows:

```
nonterminal ExprList Vec<LBox<Expr<'lt>>>
```

Then replace the two production rules for `ExprList` with the following:

```rust
ExprList --> Expr:[e] ; { vec![e] }
ExprList --> ExprList:v Expr:[e] ;  { v.push(e); v }

```
The presence of a non-empty semantic action will override automatic AST generation.
It is also possible to inject custom code into the
automatically generated code:
```
ExprList --> Expr ; {println!("starting a new ExprList sequence"); ... }
```
The ellipsis are allowed only before the closing right-brace.  This indicates
that the automatically generated portion of the semantic action should follow.
The ellipsis cannot appear anywhere else.

An easier way to parse a sequence of expressions separated by ; is to
use the special suffixes `+`, `*`, `?`, `<_*>` and `<_+>`.  These are described below.

```

```


   -------------------

### Automatically Adding New Rules with *, + and ?

A relatively new feature of rustlr (since verion 0.2.9) allows the use of regular-expression style symbols *, + and ? to automatically generate new production rules.  However, these symbols cannot be used unrestrictedly to form arbitrary
regular expressions. They cannot be nested.  They are also guaranteed to only fully work in the -auto mode.

Another way to achieve the same effects as the above (to derive a vector for symbol ExprList) is to use the following alternative grammar declarations:

```
nonterminal ExprList Vec<LBox<Expr<'lt>>>
ExprList --> (Expr ;)*
```

The operator **`*`** means a sequence of zero or more.  This is done by generating several new non-terminal symbols internally.  Essentially, these correspond to

```
ES0 --> Expr:e ; {e}
ES1 --> { Vec::new() }
ES1 --> ES1:v ES0:[e] { v.push(e); v }
ExprList --> ES1:v {v}
```
These rules replace the original in the grammar.  In the -auto mode,
rustlr also infers that symbols such as ; has no meaning at the
AST level (because it has the unit type and noprecedence/associativity
declaration). It therefore infers that the type of the nonterminal ES0
is the same as Expr, and automatically generates the appropriate semantic action.
If override of this behavior is required, one can manually rewrite the grammar
as
```
ES0:SEMI --> Expr ; 
ExprList --> ES0*
```
The presence of the left-hand side label will cause the AST generator to 
create an AST representation for the semicolon (assuming that is what's
desired).  Another situation where the user has to write the ES0 rule
manually is if `-auto` (or `-genabsyn`) is not specified, which implies
that a rule with an explicit semantic action is required.  Generally speaking,
the *, + and ? symbols will still work without `-auto` if it follows a
single grammar symbol.

The type rustlr associates with the new non-terminal ES1
will be `Vec<LBox<Expr<'lt>>` and semantic actions are generated to
create the vector for both ES1 rules.  A **`+`** means one or more
`ES1` derivations, producing the same vector type, and a **`?`** will
mean one or zero derivations with type `Option<LBox<Expr<'lt>>>`.

Other alternatives are possible:
```
nonterminal ExprList
ExprList:Sequence --> (Expr ;)*
```
This would generate a new struct type for the AST of ExprList, with a component of
type
`Vec<LBox<Expr<'lt>>>`.  If the type of ExprList is declared manually
as above, rustlr infers that the appropriate semantic action is equivalent to
`ExprList --> (Expr ;)*:v {v}`  because there is only one symbol (the internally
generated ES1) on the right-hand side, and it is of the same type.
**The label given for such an expression cannot be a pattern that includes `@...@`.**  It can only be a simple alphanumeric label or a boxed label (`[x]`).  These restrictions may eventually be eliminated in future releases.

Another restriction is that the symbols `(`, `)`, `?`, `*` and `+` may not
be separated by white spaces since that would confuse their interpretation
as independent terminal symbols.  For example, `( Expr ; ) *` is not valid.

Yet another alternative is to manually define the type of ExprList, from which Rustlr will infer that no struct/enum needs to be created for it:
```
nonterminal ExprList Vec<LBox<Expr<'lt>>>
ExprList --> (Expr ;)*
```
This is because rustlr generates an internal non-terminal to represent the right-hand side `*` expression and assigns it type `Vec<LBox<Expr<'lt>>>`.
It then recognizes that this is the only symbol on the
right, which is of the same type as the left-hand side nonterminal `ExprList`
as declared. This rule will again be given an action equivalent to
`ExprList --> (Expr ;)*:v {v}`

In addition to the `*`, `+` and `?` suffixes, rustlr also recognizes (non-nested)
suffixes such as **`<Comma*>`** or **`<;+>`**.  Assuming that
`Comma` is a declared terminal symbol of the grammer, the expression
`Expr<Comma+>` represents a sequence of one or more Expr separated by Comma,
but not ending in Comma, e.g *a,b,c* but not *a,b,c,*.  In contrast,
`(Expr Comma)+` means that the expression must end in a Comma.  <Comma*>
allows the sequence to be empty. The AST generator will also create vectors
as the semantic values of such expressions.  Please avoid whitespaces in
these expressions: `<Comma *>` is not recognized.

Be warned that overusing `+`, `*` and `?`, especially in the same
production rule, can easily lead to new ambiguities in the grammar, especially
with `*` and `?`.  The new productions generated for these operators
could lead to additional Shift-Reduce and even
Reduce-Reduce conflicts.  For example, a production with right-hand side
**`Expr<Comma*> Comma?`** will lead to a shift-reduce conflict. However,
**`Expr<Comma+> Comma?`** will not.

Generally speaking, context free grammars do not have the same
properties as regular expressions.  Regex operators including
`*`, `+` and `?` can be used in any combination such as `(a+a?)*` and we
can always create an optimized, deterministic finite state machine to
recognize it.  But grammars cannot be composed without losing their
properties.  A rule like `A --> B* B*` is hopelessly ambiguous as
there is no way to determine where the first sequence should stop and
the second one begins.  In such a situation, rustlr will still create a
parser by using defaults such as shift-over-reduce, but not before printing
out a warning.

The motivation for adding regex-like operators to a parser generator
are both usability and improved ability in creating abstract syntax
automatically.  But much work needs to be done before we can parse
arbitrary EBNF syntax.  We are currently exploring extensions of LR
parsing including *delayed reductions*, which can potentially allow
non-ambiguous grammars to be more easily composed without running into
new conflicts.


### Invoking the Parser

Since the grammar also contains lexer generation directives, all we need to do is to write the procedures that interpret the AST (see [main](https://cs.hofstra.edu/~cscccl/rustlr_project/autocalc/src/main.rs)).  The procedure to invoke the parser is the same as described in [Chapter 3][chap3], using the **`parse_with`** or **`parse_train_with`** functions:

```rust
   let mut scanner = calcautoparser::calcautolexer::from_str("2*3+1;");
   let mut parser = calcautoparser::make_parser();
   let result = calcautoparser::parse_with(&mut parser, &mut scanner);
   let tree = result.unwrap_or_else(|x|{println!("Parsing errors encountered; results are partial.."); x});
   println!("\nAST: {:?}\n",&tree);
   
```
The `parse_with` and `parse_train_with` functions were also backported for
grammars with a single *absyntype.*

Please note that all generated enums for the grammar will attempt to derive the Debug trait (as well as implement the Default trait).

Please also note that using [LBox][2] is already included in all parsers generated with the `-genabsyn` or `-auto` option, so do not use `!use ...` to include
it again.

### JSON Parser

To give another, complete example of the features described in this chapter,
we build a parser for JSON.  The grammar is as follows
```
# Rustlr grammar use with -auto
lifetime 'lt
lexterminal LBRACE {
lexterminal RBRACE }
lexterminal LBRACK [
lexterminal RBRACK ]
lexterminal LPAREN (
lexterminal RPAREN )
lexterminal COLON :
lexterminal COMMA ,
lexterminal NULL null
lexterminal MINUS -
valueterminal TRUE~ bool~ Alphanum("true")~ true
valueterminal FALSE~ bool~ Alphanum("false")~ false
valueterminal STRING~ &'lt str~ Strlit(n)~ &n[1..n.len()-1]
valueterminal NUM~ i64~ Num(n)~ n
valueterminal FLOAT~ f64~ Float(n)~ n
valueterminal BIGNUM~ &'lt str~ BigNumber(n)~ n

nonterminal Integer i64
nonterminal Floatpt f64
nonterminal Boolean bool
nonterminals Number Value KeyValPair
nonterminal List Vec<LBox<Value<'lt>>>
nonterminal Object Vec<LBox<KeyValPair<'lt>>>

topsym Value
resync COMMA RBRACK RBRACE

Integer --> MINUS?:m NUM:n {if m.is_some() {n*-1} else {n}}
Floatpt --> MINUS?:m FLOAT:n {if m.is_some() {-1.0*n} else {n}} 
Number:Bignum --> MINUS?:m BIGNUM
Number:Int --> Integer
Number:Float --> Floatpt
Boolean --> TRUE | FALSE

Value:Number --> Number
Value:Bool --> Boolean
Value:Str --> STRING
Value:Object --> Object
Value:List --> List
Value --> NULL
Value --> LPAREN Value RPAREN
KeyValPair --> STRING COLON Value
List --> LBRACK Value<COMMA*> RBRACK
Object --> LBRACE KeyValPair<COMMA*> RBRACE
```

This grammar uses the latest variations on Rustlr syntax that were introduced
in more recent versions.
Note that the **`valueterminal`** lines, which combine `typedterminal` with
`lexvalue` declarations, requires that their components be separated by
a **`~`**.  The line for terminal STRING strips the string literal returned
by the tokenizer of this enclosing double quotes.

The AST types that are created by this JSON parser are
```
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum Number<'lt> {
  Int(i64),
  Bignum(Option<()>,&'lt str),
  Float(f64),
  Number_Nothing,
}
impl<'lt> Default for Number<'lt> { fn default()->Self { Number::Number_Nothing } }

#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum Value<'lt> {
  Str(&'lt str),
  List(Vec<LBox<Value<'lt>>>),
  NULL,
  Object(Vec<LBox<KeyValPair<'lt>>>),
  Bool(bool),
  Number(Number<'lt>),
  Value_Nothing,
}
impl<'lt> Default for Value<'lt> { fn default()->Self { Value::Value_Nothing } }

#[derive(Default,Debug)]
pub struct KeyValPair<'lt>(pub &'lt str,pub LBox<Value<'lt>>,);
```

Notice that we explicitly defined the types of `List` and `Object` to be
the type that we know will be generated by `<COMMA*>`.  This avoided the
creation of redundant new types, which would have been:
```
pub struct Object<'lt>(pub Vec<LBox<KeyValPair<'lt>>>,);
pub struct List<'lt>(pub Vec<LBox<Value<'lt>>>,);
```
These new types would mean, for example, that `[1,2,3]` would be represented
as `List(List([Number(Int(1)),Number(Int(2)),Number(Int(3))]))` instead of
just `List([Number(Int(1)),Number(Int(2)),Number(Int(3))])`.  With the explicit
type declarations Rustlr was able to recognize that the only non-unit
typed symbol on the right-hand side of the rule has the same
type as the left-side-side symbol, and thus generated the semantic
action correctly without creating another type.

The following is the Debug-output of a sample AST produced by the parser,
from which anyone familiar with JSON can surely discern the original source:
```
Object([KeyValPair("firstName", Str("John")), KeyValPair("lastName", Str("Smith")), KeyValPair("isAlive", Bool(true)), KeyValPair("age", Number(Int(30))), KeyValPair("address", Object([KeyValPair("streetAddress", Str("121 2nd Street")), KeyValPair("city", Str("New York")), KeyValPair("state", Str("NY")), KeyValPair("postalCode", Str("10021-3100"))])), KeyValPair("phoneNumbers", List([Object([KeyValPair("type", Str("home")), KeyValPair("number", Str("212 555-1234"))]), Object([KeyValPair("type", Str("office")), KeyValPair("number", Str("646 555-4567"))])])), KeyValPair("children", List([Str("Catherine"), Str("Thomas"), Str("Trevor")])), KeyValPair("spouse", NULL)])
```

Finally, here is an alternative way to parse JSON objects into
Rust HashMaps.  We can override not only the type to be generated but the
semantic action as well.  Modify the declarations and rules for Object as
follows:
```
$use std::collections::HashMap;
nonterminal Object HashMap<&'lt str,LBox<Value<'lt>>>
Object ==> LBRACE KeyValPair<COMMA*>:entries RBRACE {
  let mut kvmap = HashMap::new();
  for (mut lbx) in entries {
    if let KeyValPair(k,v) = lbx.take() { kvmap.insert(k,v); }
  }
  kvmap
  } <==
```
The `$` directive is similar to `!`, except that it adds the verbatim line
only to the generated AST file as opposed to parser file. Each key-value
pair inside the vector created by `<COMMA*>` is wrapped inside an LBox.
We can take the value from the box with [LBox::take][take] (which leaves
a default value inside the box).

The debug output of the same JSON source would now be:
```
Object({"age": Number(Int(30)), "isAlive": Boolean(true), "children": List([Str("Catherine"), Str("Thomas"), Str("Trevor")]), "firstName": Str("John"), "address": Object({"state": Str("NY"), "streetAddress": Str("121 2nd Street"), "postalCode": Str("10021-3100"), "city": Str("New York")}), "spouse": NULL, "lastName": Str("Smith"), "phoneNumbers": List([Object({"type": Str("home"), "number": Str("212 555-1234")}), Object({"number": Str("646 555-4567"), "type": Str("office")})])})
```

Although we may at times want to insert such overrides, most of the
automatically generated portions remain usable.

Here are links to the [grammar](https://cs.hofstra.edu/~cscccl/rustlr_project/jsontypes/json.grammar), [parser](https://cs.hofstra.edu/~cscccl/rustlr_project/jsontypes/src/jsonparser.rs), [ast types](https://cs.hofstra.edu/~cscccl/rustlr_project/jsontypes/src/json_ast.rs) and [main](https://cs.hofstra.edu/~cscccl/rustlr_project/jsontypes/src/main.rs) of the project, which may differ slightly
from the above.
